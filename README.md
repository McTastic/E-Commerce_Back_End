## Description:

Here is a basic back-end for any online store using a database. It catalogues data and allows this data to be added, updated, or deleted as needed. This data can be anything that a store would list as a product and allows the products to be attached to speicific tags and categories as well as indicating how many are in stock. See the demos above for a breakdown of all routes and what they are doing.
